TitleTicker
===========

> This project can run and works correctly! :white_check_mark:

This project is a basic javascript module.

## What does it do?

It has tons of effects that you can do to the title of a page (by tons I currently mean 2)

It degrades well if javascript is off - It just shows the normal title.

It gzips to _1kb_ though could be optimized more, though to the disadvantage of the beauty of the code.

To run the project go to http://www.george.padolsey.com/JavascriptProjects/TitleTicker/demo.htm

To see the documentation go to http://www.george.padolsey.com/JavascriptProjects/TitleTicker/jsdoc/

Then check the source on Github!

If you get any errors please submit an issue on Github.

Current Problems: 
- Moar Effects!
