Gun Test
========

> This project can run though it is very bad code / provides very little substance for a program :warning:

Made in 2011

## What does it do?

It makes a gun follow the mouse and also if you press the keys the gun will move; it is really a simple test I made for fun. :beginner:

To run the project go to http://www.george.padolsey.com/JavascriptProjects/gunTest/index.htm

Then check the source on Github!

If you get any errors, I'm sorry but I won't be fixing them due to this being a test project.
