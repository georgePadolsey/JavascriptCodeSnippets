> This project can run and works correctly! :white_check_mark:

This project is a basic javascript module.

## What does it do?

It makes it so on hovering over a link like below: 

![](example.png?raw=true)

It shows different text instead of the normal URL text. Though when clicked still goes to the same location.

It degrades well if javascript is off - It just shows the normal hover over text.

It gzips to _1kb_ though could be optimized more, though to the disadvantage of the beauty of the code.

To run the project go to http://www.george.padolsey.com/JavascriptProjects/aReplace/demo.htm

To see the documentation go to http://www.george.padolsey.com/JavascriptProjects/aReplace/jsdoc/

Then check the source on Github!

If you get any errors please submit an issue on Github.

Current Problems: 
- You can't specify a specific anchor element, you have to specify a container
