Javascript Projects
===================

This Github repository is full of little projects I made while experimenting with javascript.

Most of the projects in here are not of the best of programming quality; they are purely me experimenting with javascript and learning with it.

Each project will have a readme.md file inside detailing how to run it.

Some projects may not be to the best of quality. They will say if they are inside there README.md, also check the list below.
